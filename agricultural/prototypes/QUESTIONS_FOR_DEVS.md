# Questions for the CYCLES developers

Running list, compiled while building an independent, from-scratch reimplementation
of CYCLES' published equations for classroom use (see CLAUDE.md, "Agricultural unit"
section, for the full context on why this is a from-scratch build rather than a port
of the real source). Intent: one short, specific list sent once we have a
classroom-workable tool, not an ongoing back-and-forth. Each item below is something
the public paper and its Supplemental Information don't specify precisely enough to
resolve from public information alone, verified by actually trying and checking
against real Cycles output before concluding the gap is real.

## Open

1. **Curve-number moisture adjustment (`fwc`).** SI Section III describes it only in
   words ("1 for a soil saturated to a depth of 0.6 m... decreases to zero if the
   soil is air dry... depth-weighted... surface having the most importance") with no
   actual formula. What's the exact functional form and depth-weighting?

2. **Bare-soil and residue evaporation.** The SI's own process flowchart (Figure
   SI.2) marks "Soil Evaporation" and "Residue Evaporation" with the same "detailed
   in this SI" marker used for vegetation transpiration, but no evaporation equation
   is actually present anywhere in the document (SI Section II is transpiration
   only). What's the actual formula?

3. **Shoot/root partitioning's `TTf50` parameter (Eq. SI.8-11).** The equation and
   its shape parameters (`fsti`, `fstf`) are given, but `TTf50` (the thermal-time
   fraction at half-max allocation) has no stated numeric value or way to derive it
   per crop. We used 0.5 (the literal reading of the parameter's own name) --
   confirm or correct.

4. **Perennial forage cutting trigger (`CLIPPING_BIOMASS_THRESHOLD_UPPER` /
   `HARVEST_TIMING` interaction).** For orchardgrass at Rock Springs (real
   `GenericCrops.crop` values verified directly: `MATURITY_TT=1500`,
   `CLIPPING_BIOMASS_THRESHOLD_UPPER=4` Mg/ha, `CLIPPING_BIOMASS_THRESHOLD_LOWER=1`
   Mg/ha, `HARVEST_TIMING=60`%, `STANDING_RESIDUE_AT_HARVEST=50`%,
   `RESIDUE_REMOVED=80`%), we've now ruled out four candidate trigger mechanisms
   with real data, not just two:
   - **Fixed absolute biomass threshold**: real pre-cut aboveground biomass across
     1982's four cuts is 2.24, 1.27, 2.25, 2.10 Mg/ha -- none within reach of the
     4.0 Mg/ha upper threshold (closest is 56% of it).
   - **Fixed thermal-time-since-last-cut threshold**: real Cycles' own daily
     THERMAL TIME column resets at each cut, but the thermal time accumulated
     between resets varies from 442 to 802 degree-days across the four 1982
     cuts -- there's no fixed value that would fit `HARVEST_TIMING=60%` of
     `MATURITY_TT` (which would predict a fixed ~900).
   - **Growth-rate plateau** (cut when regrowth stalls, regardless of absolute
     level): checked the daily aboveground biomass trajectory for all four days
     leading into each cut -- growth is steady and still increasing right up to
     the cut day every time, no slowdown.
   - **A simple fixed reset fraction after cutting**: comparing real Cycles' own
     pre-cut aboveground biomass (from `harvest.txt`'s TOTAL BIOMASS minus ROOT
     BIOMASS) against the very next value in the daily crop file (which already
     reflects the post-cut state) gives a strikingly consistent ~25% carryover
     ratio for 3 of the 4 real 1982 cuts (0.250, 0.250, 0.250) -- notably not the
     `STANDING_RESIDUE_AT_HARVEST=50%` crop-file value read naively, and not the
     literal `AG RESIDUE` harvest.txt column either (which nets out to ~5% of
     aboveground biomass and is evidently a separate "litter left on the ground"
     accounting, not the living carryover that continues to grow -- the
     harvest.txt FORAGE YIELD + AG RESIDUE columns already sum to 100% of AG
     biomass, so neither represents what's left standing). The same daily file's
     thermal-time reset also lands at a similar ~25-33% fraction of its pre-cut
     value in the same three cuts. One of the four cuts (1982-07-08, the one
     with by far the shortest pre-cut biomass, 1.27 Mg/ha) is an outlier on both
     measures at once (~34% and ~33%), suggesting a distinct rule may apply near
     the `CLIPPING_BIOMASS_THRESHOLD_LOWER=1` boundary. Implementing the 25%
     reset fraction (replacing an earlier attempt's 50% guess) on top of the
     unchanged dual biomass-OR-thermal-time trigger did not fix correlation
     (-0.276 -> 0.156, still not classroom-workable) and made the level bias
     worse (ratio 1.825 -> 3.305), since the larger residual regrows faster and
     causes more frequent cuts than reality.

   With all four mechanical hypotheses now ruled out by direct comparison against
   real per-cut data, what's left is either something not in the disclosed
   management parameters at all (a scheduling constraint, e.g. a minimum days-
   between-cuts rule, or a seasonal/photoperiod adjustment to the thermal-time
   target) or a genuinely different formula than "biomass OR thermal-time,
   whichever first." What is the actual trigger logic, and is the post-cut reset
   (both biomass and thermal time) really a fixed ~25% carryover, or does it
   depend on which threshold fired?

5. **Canopy-cover shape constants (Eq. 6's `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) per crop.** The paper
   gives explicit defaults (6, -20, -15, 16) but states they "represent a normalized
   plant density (PDf) of 1" for the case demonstrated. Checked directly for winter
   wheat: at the point real Cycles shows 0.746 canopy cover (thermal-time fraction
   0.40), the same constants predict 0.886 -- a real, verified gap, not noise. Ruled
   out thermal-time accumulation as the cause first (our value: 1783.6 vs. real
   1740.76 by harvest, within 2.5% -- fine). Are there different shape constants per
   crop, or a correction beyond the stated `PDf` adjustment (Eq. 7) we're missing?
   Follow-up: even for corn itself the stated defaults run ~5% high at peak canopy
   (real 0.943 vs. predicted 0.990) -- negligible for grain corn (harvest happens
   well into senescence, after growth has already stopped) but compounds into a
   real, growing error for a crop harvested mid-peak-growth (confirmed directly:
   silage corn's aboveground biomass ratio to real output grows from 1.00 at
   mid-season to 1.25 by its 85%-of-maturity harvest point, tracking almost exactly
   with the compounding canopy-cover gap). A corn-specific refit (6, -20, -12, 12)
   helps the level bias but not silage corn's underlying correlation problem (item 6).

6. **Silage corn's and winter wheat's weak year-to-year correlation (0.50 and
   0.25) turn out to be two distinct problems, not one, after directly comparing
   our computed water stress against real Cycles' own WATER STRESS output column
   (day-by-day, not just season totals) -- worth being specific since we ruled out
   several things and want to avoid the devs re-suggesting them:

   - **Silage corn**: the *magnitude* of stress is right (our model and real
     Cycles both show severe stress, and real layer 1-3 soil moisture is
     genuinely down near wilting point, e.g. 0.13-0.17 m3/m3, during the real
     2016 stress peak -- a bona fide drought, nothing anomalous), but the
     *timing* is off by about 11 days (our stress onsets 2016-07-11, real onsets
     2016-06-30) and the within-event shape differs (real stress oscillates/dips
     through late July where ours rises smoothly). We tested three independent,
     principled fixes across all four already-validated crops (corn, soybean,
     wheat, silage corn) to see if any single recalibration closed this without
     breaking corn/soybean, which currently pass: (a) raising the "readily
     available water" stress-onset threshold from 0.5 toward 0.8, (b) slowing
     the root-growth-vs-thermal-time curve (root_depth = root_max*min(1,ttf/K)
     for K from 0.3 to 1.0), (c) widening bare-soil evaporation's extraction
     depth from one 5cm layer to FAO-56's standard evaporable-surface-layer
     depth Ze (0.10-0.30m, Allen et al. 1998 -- a real public constant, not a
     guess). None of the three meaningfully moved silage corn's correlation, and
     all three made corn/soybean modestly worse as the parameter increased. This
     points at the soil water *redistribution* physics itself (Eq. 1-2's actual
     sub-daily, capacitance-weighted flow, which our engine approximates with a
     same-day cascading bucket) rather than the crop-side stress-response
     formula -- see item 7 below, which is really the same underlying gap.

   - **Winter wheat**: a much stranger anomaly, not a timing/shape issue at all.
     Real wheat yield correlates -0.89 with real Cycles' own max-per-season
     WATER STRESS across the 9 harvested years (1988-2015) -- confirming stress
     genuinely is the dominant driver of real yield variation, not a red
     herring. But our model's max-per-season stress only correlates 0.37 against
     real Cycles' max-per-season stress, and shows *zero* stress in three years
     (2003, 2009, 2012) where real Cycles reports 27-60%. Tracing the worst case
     (2012, real max stress 59.5% on 2012-03-16) against real Cycles' own
     water.txt output for that exact date: layer-1 soil moisture is 0.305 m3/m3
     against a field capacity of 0.339 -- only mildly depleted, about 83% of
     field capacity -- while the crop is still early vegetative growth
     (thermal time 755 of 1800 to maturity, 42%). No standard depletion-fraction
     stress function we're aware of would produce 60% stress from that mild a
     deficit. We first suspected our thermal-time engine was desynced from a
     real winter dormancy period Cycles might model that ours doesn't -- ruled
     out by comparing day-by-day thermal-time accumulation (not just the harvest
     total) against real Cycles' own THERMAL TIME column for the full
     1987-10-15 to 1988-07-07 season: every checkpoint matches within 1-3%,
     including both trajectories going flat in December-January. So the
     phenological calendar itself is fine. What's left: either (a) wheat's real
     root-growth-vs-thermal-time curve is far shallower/slower early on than
     the shape we're using for every crop (meaning a much smaller root zone is
     being checked for depletion, and that thin zone dries out fast even from
     modest rain gaps), or (b) wheat's actual water-stress function is far more
     sensitive/nonlinear than a linear depletion ramp, or (c) something early
     season-specific (cold soil restricting uptake, a minimum-root-depth floor)
     that isn't a "water stress" mechanism in the way we've modeled it at all.
     What is wheat's actual root growth function, and does WATER STRESS for
     wheat reflect soil moisture alone or something else layered on top?

7. **The soil water redistribution scheme (Eq. 1-2) is disclosed but requires
   soil hydraulic parameters we don't have a verified source for.** The paper
   gives the real capacitance-weighted flow equation (khe as a function of
   saturated hydraulic conductivity ks, air-entry potential psi_e, and the
   moisture-release-curve exponent b, integrated between current water
   potential and field capacity) rather than our simplified same-day cascading
   bucket. Saxton and Rawls (2006) -- the same paper we already use for field
   capacity/wilting point/saturation -- reportedly also gives b, psi_e, and Ks
   as functions of soil texture, but we could not verify the exact secondary
   formulas from a reachable public source this session (every mirror we tried
   was blocked by this sandbox's network policy, not a paywall we could
   confirm). If the devs can point to Cycles' own effective/reduced form of Eq.
   1-2 (e.g. what it collapses to at a daily timestep, if anything), or confirm
   the exact Saxton-Rawls secondary formulas, that would let us implement the
   real redistribution physics instead of the bucket approximation -- which we
   now believe is the most likely single fix for silage corn's timing problem
   (item 6) and possibly a contributor to wheat's, though wheat's anomaly above
   looks like a separate, crop-specific issue on top of this.

## Resolved without asking (kept here for the record, not blocking)

- Cycles' `HARVEST_INDEX` is grain ÷ *aboveground* biomass, not total -- worked out
  by checking real output arithmetic directly (11.61 / (26.17 - 3.48) = 0.5117,
  matching the real reported value).
- Two likely sign errors in the SI's typeset equations (curve-number runoff
  denominator; the wet-curve-number formula) were resolved by deriving from the
  external standard methods the SI itself cites (USDA-SCS 1972; Williams et al.
  2012), not by asking -- flagged in code, not on this list.
